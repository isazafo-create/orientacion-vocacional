# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple multi-page web application. It starts with a landing page that has a button to navigate to a second page.

## Project Structure & Design

This section is being reverted to its original state.

## Current Task: Revert all HTML and CSS changes

### Plan

1.  **Revert `index.html`**: Restore `index.html` to its original state, with the button link outside the `<body>` tag.
2.  **Revert `style.css`**: Clear all content from `style.css` to remove all styles that were added.
